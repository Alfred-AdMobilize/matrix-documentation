# Workflow

## Application
Each application has an `config.yaml` file which determines several things.

1. How to evaluate and categorize the application for the MatrixOS app Store
1. Application dashboard widget layout, display and data sources
1. Runtime variables used by Matrix applications
1. Fixed data structure for saving information and routing to dashboard.
1. What external services, such as CV and sensors, will be used, and how will they be provided to the app.

External services can also be coded in the application directly.

## Validation
Inside the [matrix-app-config-helper](https://github.com/matrix-io/matrix-app-config-helper) repository the configuration is validated to be soundly structured.

## Population
In order to standardize the configuration, as well as permit a wide variety of user configuration interpretations, a population step is performedÂ before the finished record is stored.

## Role of Firebase
Firebase is the primary store of application configuration. It permits us to dynamically refresh the application when the configuration changes. If an application does not have a Firebase configuration, the `config.yaml` file is validated, populated and stored inside Firebase with the following structure. `userId > deviceId > appName`. 

## Meta Information
`name`, `version`, `description` are used internally and for the Matrix App Store


## Data Types
If you've setup a migration or an SQL table, this is a very simple structure to tell the application what sort of data you will be passing around.

```
dataTypes:
  foobar: integer
```

See [Data Types](datatypes.md)

## Screens & Widgets
Two root nodes. `screens` and `widgets` work together to determine layout and content.

### Screens
Screens notates a nested array which informs the dashboard how to layout the widgets.
```
screens:
  - - a
    - b
    - foo
  - - 1
    - 2
    - 3

// => turns into

[ [ a, b, foo ], [ 1, 2, 3 ] ]
```
Sub arrays correlates to rows in a display.
The above would display on the dashboard as follows:
```
[a][b][foo]
[1][2][3]
```
The value in the array corresponds to a widget name.

### Widgets
Widgets describe the module to load inside a designated screen.
```
widgets:
  foo:
    # type defines what type of data this widget should display
    type: foobar
    # if provided, label shows above each widget
    label: Foo widget
```
