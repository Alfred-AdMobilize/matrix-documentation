# Welcome to the Official MatrixOS Documentation

MatrixOS is a device and language agnostic approach towards building IoT applications which can utilize sensors, integrations, external API's and powerful computer vision, to drive real world behavior.

All the hardware is abstracted away, so you don't have to worry about reading voltages.
All the infrastructure is provided, so you can easily gather data from hundreds of devices in real time.

## Overview
[CLI](CLI/overview.md) - Manage your devices and apps through the CLI

[Config](Configuration/overview.md) - App configuration informs device permissions, dashboards, data storage, app meta information and service integrations

[API](API/overview.md) - MatrixOS syntax and examples

## Language Support
Currently, MatrixOS supports JavaScript. Next on the list is Python.
